                <p class="para">I graduated with a B.Sc. <br>in Computer Science and Engineering from the American International University-Bangladesh (AIUB)<br>,  specializing in Information Systems.<br> My academic journey has equipped me<br> with a strong foundation in C&C++, HTML, CSS, and PHP. <br>I have also gained proficiency in JavaScript, Oracle, MySQL, <br>GitHub, Linux, Windows, Weka, FTP,<br> TCP/IP, Teamwork, and Microsoft Office.
